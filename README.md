#TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) Overview

TCP is a fundamental protocol that facilitates end-to-end communication, offering a logical channel for communication between application processes on different hosts. It ensures reliable data transfer services between applications on the internet, guaranteeing error-free, sequential, and non-duplicated data delivery.

TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, relying on the concept of sockets (IP address + port) to establish connections. This allows for the creation of reliable connections with predefined quality of service and security parameters.
